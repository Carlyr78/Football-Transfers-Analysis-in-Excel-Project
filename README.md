Database Review
Use the Football data_source.xlsx file to identify and fill in any missing data in the database for the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 seasons. Take some time to review the database for errors and correct them.

Go to the Database sheet, where you’ll find empty columns that need to be filled in by the information from the Countries sheet.
How do you process the data in Countries? Excel offers multiple ways to solve most tasks. In this case, one viable option is to use the Text-to-Columns feature to make matters easier.

Next, it's time to check out the Season column in the database for any inconsistencies—perhaps a year that seems out of place. You can create a header filter in Excel to help you do this effectively. If you find an incorrect year in the Season column, don't worry; Excel’s Find and Replace tool will come in handy by correcting the year.
The last task involves filling in the two Continent columns in the Database sheet.

Analyze the Aggregate Number of European Transfers

Create a table showing the total number of football transfers in and out of Europe during the two seasons under examination. We're interested in the net transfer balance. Does Europe, overall, import or export more players?

To perform this analysis using Excel functions, you will need to fill in the following table:
This table will use the SUMIFS function because all the criteria we need are in it. Using SUMIFS, you can tally up all the incoming and outgoing transfers for both seasons and then calculate the net transfer balance.

Create another table listing the net transfer movements for each European country during the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 seasons. Include the number of transfers and the total cost, giving you a clearer picture of how money moves around in European football transfers.

To do this, first, gather a list of unique European countries from our football transfer data.

Once you have this, create and fill in the table:

Visualize Transfer Fees of Top 5 European Countries
Let’s focus on the big spenders. Identify the top five European countries that invested the most in incoming transfers in the 2022/2023 season.
For these countries, create a graphic showing the number of players they brought in, and the average transfer fee spent per player.

Consider the following steps:

1. Determine which five European countries invested the most in incoming transfers during the 2022/2023 season.

2. Calculate the average fee each of these countries paid per player by dividing the total amount spent on incoming transfers by the number of these transfers.

3. Visualize the data. Your graphic should represent the number of transfers for each country on one axis. Add a secondary axis to display the average fee paid in each country.
